<h2><b>Let-s-Gogh---PhotoHunt:</b></h2>

The Let's Gogh Photohunt app allows students and teachers to create a list of scavenger hunt questions for people to play. After the quiz is created, people can then go on fun scavenger adventures to answer and upload an image of the item that's being looked for.
